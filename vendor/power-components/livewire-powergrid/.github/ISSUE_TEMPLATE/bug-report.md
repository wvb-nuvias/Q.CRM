Thank you for reporting a bug and helping us to improve our software!

## Guidelines

`   üêõ `   We use GitHub Issues **EXCLUSIVELY** for tracking bugs and unexpected software behavior.

`   üôè `  Questions like _"How to...",_ "_how can I..."_, _"I would like to..."_ should be posted in the [Discussions](https://github.com/Power-Components/livewire-powergrid/discussions) tab.

`   ‚úçÔ∏è `  Give this report a short but meaningful title. Make it easy to spot for others who might be facing the same issue.

`   ‚ö†Ô∏è `  Issues that do not describe a bug will be closed.
