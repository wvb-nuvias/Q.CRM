php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" # view only
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" --write # view & write to file
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" --short-class # new option - use short class instead of full namespace path

php artisan eloquent:bulk-phpdoc "app/Models/*.php" # bulk generation (force write mode)
```

* @property \Carbon\Carbon|null|null $email_verified_at
* @property string $password

Thank you for using EloquentDocs!
```

</details>

Note: if you haven't installed `doctrine/dbal` as your dev-dependency, 
then once you trigger the command for the first time, it will help you to install the needful dependency

## Best practices
- Use `$casts` in your model, in order to help EloquentPhpDoc generate better types for you (array, Carbon,...)
- For `get*Attribute` accessor, always declare the return type

Note: Eloquent new `Attribute` class utilize the data via Closure, thus we can't declare any return type for any attributes.
For this case, EloquentPhpDoc will always return `mixed`
